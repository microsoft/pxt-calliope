# micro:bit target for PXT

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/pxt-microbit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/pxt-microbit)

pxt-microbit is a [Microsoft Programming Experience Toolkit (PXT)](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt) target that allows you to program a [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org/). 
* pxt-microbit ``v1.*`` requires pxt v4.x, which is currently in the [master branch of pxt](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt/tree/master).
* pxt-microbit ``v0.*`` is in the [v0 branch of this repository](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-microbit/tree/v0)

* [Try it live](https://makecode.microbit.org/)

## Issue tracking

Please add an issue if you discover an (unreported) bug.

## Developing new extensions

Authoring and testing of new extensions can be done directly from the web editor. See [our documentation](https://makecode.com/blog/github-packages) on how to get started. If you want to run the editor locally, keep reading.

## Local server

The local server lets you to run the editor and serve the documentation from your own computer. It is meant for a single developer used and not designed to serve the editor to a large amount of users.

### Developer Setup

This is the typical setup used by the MakeCode team to work on the microbit.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 8.9.4 or higher.
2. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) if you plan to build ``.cpp`` files.
3. Clone the pxt repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/pxt
cd pxt
```
4. Install the dependencies of pxt and build it
```
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```
5. Clone the pxt-common-packages repository
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-common-packages
cd pxt-common-packages
npm install
cd ..
```
6. Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-microbit
cd pxt-microbit
```
7. Install the PXT command line (add `sudo` for Mac/Linux shells).
```
npm install -g pxt
```
8. Install the pxt-microbit dependencies.
```
npm install
```
8. Link pxt-microbit back to base pxt repo (add `sudo` for Mac/Linux shells).
```
npm link ../pxt
npm link ../pxt-common-packages
```
Note the above command assumes the folder structure of   
```
       makecode
          |
  ----------------------------------
  |       |                        |
 pxt      pxt-common-packages  pxt-microbit
 ```

### Running

Run this command from inside pxt-microbit to open a local web server
```
pxt serve
```
If the local server opens in the wrong browser, make sure to copy the URL containing the local token. 
Otherwise, the editor will not be able to load the projects.

If you need to modify the `.cpp` files (and have installed yotta), enable yotta compilation using the `--localbuild` flag:
```
pxt serve --local
```

If you want to speed up the build, you can use the ``rebundle`` option, which skips building and simply refreshes the target information
```
pxt serve --rebundle
```

### Cleaning

Sometimes, your built folder might be in a bad state, clean it and try again.
```
pxt clean
```

### Updates

Make sure to pull changes from all repos regularly. More instructions are at https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt#running-a-target-from-localhost

## Repos 

The pxt-microbit target depends on several other repos. The main ones are:
- https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt, the PXT framework
- https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-common-packages, common APIs accross various MakeCode editors
- https://github.com/lancaster-university/microbit, basic wrapper around the DAL

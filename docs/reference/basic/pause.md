# Pause

Pause the program for a duration of the number milliseconds you say. 
You can use this function to slow your program down.

```sig
basic.pause(400)
```

## Parameters

* **ms**: the number of milliseconds (duration) of your pause time. To convert from seconds: 100 milliseconds = 1/10 second and 1000 milliseconds = 1 second.

## Example: diagonal line

Randomly turn on and off the LED pixels on the screen.

```blocks
let duration = 500
basic.forever(function () {
    led.toggle(randint(0, 4), randint(0, 4))
    basic.pause(duration)
})
```

## Advanced

If `ms` is `NaN` (not a number), it will default to `20` ms.

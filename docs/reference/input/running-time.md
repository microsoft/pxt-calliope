# Running Time

Find how long it has been since the program started in milli-seconds.

```sig
input.runningTime();
```

## Returns

* the [Number](/types/number) of milliseconds since the program started.
(One second is 1000 milliseconds.)

## Example: elapsed time

When you press button `B` on the microbit, this
program finds the number of milliseconds since the program started
and shows it on the [LED screen](/device/screen).

```blocks
input.onButtonEvent(Button.B, ButtonEvent.Click, () => {
    let now = input.runningTime()
    basic.showNumber(now)
})
```

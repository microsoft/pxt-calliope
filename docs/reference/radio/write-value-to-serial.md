## Data received format

The format for received data printed to serial is as follows:

- [send number](/reference/radio/send-number): ```{v:ValueSent,t:MicrobitTimeAlive,s:SerialNumber}```
- [send value](/reference/radio/send-value): ```{v:ValueSent,t:MicrobitTimeAlive,s:SerialNumber,n:"Name"}```
- [send string](/reference/radio/send-string): ```{t:MicrobitTimeAlive,s:SerialNumber,n:"Text"}```

## Examples

When ```radio``` data is received (after pressing the ``A`` button on
the second @boardname@), this program sends temperature data to
serial.

```blocks
input.onButtonEvent(Button.A, ButtonEvent.Click, () => {
    radio.sendNumber(input.temperature());
});
radio.onDataReceived(() => {
    radio.writeValueToSerial();
});
```
Sample output to serial when ``A`` button pressed:

```Text
{v:27,t:323,s:0}
```

```sig
radio.onDataReceived(() => { });
```

## Example

This program keeps sending numbers that says how fast the @boardname@ is
slowing down or speeding up.  It also receives numbers for the same
thing from nearby @boardname@s. It shows these numbers as a
[bar graph](/reference/led/plot-bar-graph).

```blocks
basic.forever(() => {
    radio.sendNumber(input.acceleration(Dimension.X));
})
radio.onDataReceived(() => {
    led.plotBarGraph(radio.receiveNumber(), 1023);
})
```

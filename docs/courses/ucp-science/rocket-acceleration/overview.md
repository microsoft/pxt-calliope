# Overview

## Science Concept

The Earth exerts a gravitional force on all objects. A rocket must have a force greater than gravity to lift off. This force, acceleration, can be measured with a @boardname@ in 3 different directions or as a combined force of all three. A two liter soda bottle rocket can be made and then changes in acceleration can be measured as it lifts off and falls back to the earth.

## Project Goal

Give students real world experience with coding, collecting data, analyzing data, and reporting results using MakeCode’s block programming and a @boardname@ with its sensors.(MakeCode.org and @boardname@.org)

## Prior Knowledge

Students need to have a basic knowledge of how to code using block style programming (@boardname@ using the Windows 10 MakeCode app) and download a program to a @boardname@.

## Student Outcomes

Students will:

* Create experiments to collect data using @boardname@s and measure acceleration of a 2 liter pop bottle water rocket.
* Code the @boardname@s to collect data remotely over the @boardname@ radios.
* Analyze the data collected.
* Report on the findings of the experiments.

## Materials Needed

* 2 @boardname@s with batteries connected
* A 2 liter pop bottle rocket with nosecone 
* A 2 liter pop bottle rocket launcher
* A longer USB @boardname@ cable
* Spreadsheet for data analysis

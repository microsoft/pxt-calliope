# Algorithms

This lesson introduces a conceptual framework for thinking of a computing device as something that uses code to process one or more inputs and send them to an output(s).

## Lesson objectives
Students will...

* Understand the four components that make up a computer and their functions.
* Understand that the micro:bit takes input, and after processing the input, produces output.
* Learn the variety of different types of information the micro:bit takes in as input.
* Apply this knowledge by creating a micro:bit program that takes input and produces an output.

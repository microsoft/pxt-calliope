![micro:bit Combo Box](/static/courses/csintro/booleans/cover.jpeg)

This lesson introduces the use of the boolean data type to control the flow of a program, keep track of state, and to include or exclude certain conditions.

## Lesson objectives 
Students will...
* Understand what booleans and boolean operators are, and why and when to use them in a program.
* Learn how to create a boolean, set the boolean to an initial value, and change the value of the boolean within a micro:bit program.
* Learn how to use the random true or false block. 
* Apply the above knowledge and skills to create a unique program that uses booleans and boolean operators as an integral part of the program.

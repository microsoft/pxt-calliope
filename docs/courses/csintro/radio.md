# Radio and Communication

![Combo Box Example](/static/courses/csintro/radio/combo-box.png)

This lesson covers the use of more than one micro:bit to share and combine data. Students will explore a complex epidemiological program (Infection) that demonstrates the Radio functionality of the micro:bit. Students will send and receive numbers and strings in a series of guided activities. Finally, students are asked to collaborate so that they can share their micro:bits and create a project together.

## Lesson objectives

Students will...
* Understand how to use the Radio blocks to send and receive data between micro:bits
* Understand the specific types of data that can be sent over the Radio

## Lesson structure

* Introduction: Radio & communication
* Unplugged Activity: Infection simulation
* micro:bit Activity: Marco Polo & Morse Code
* Project: Radio
* Assessment: Rubric

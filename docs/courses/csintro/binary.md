This lesson presents the concept of binary digits and base-2 notation.  Students will learn how data is stored digitally and how it can be read and accessed.

## Lesson objectives

Students will...
* Understand what bits and bytes are and how they relate to computers and the way information is processed and stored.
* Learn to count in Base-2 (binary) and translate numbers from Base-10 (decimal) to binary and decimal.
* Apply the above knowledge and skills to create a unique program that uses binary counting as an integral part of the program.

# Science Experiments

![A watering plant with a @boardname@](/static/courses/ucp-science.jpg)

The **Science Experiments** lessons are geared for students in middle school and early high school grades. The lessons are designed help the student gain a greater understanding of the forces and behavior of the physical world. This is done using methods of observation, measurement, and data analysis. By incorporating the micro:bit in the experiments, the lessons are a great way to teach both science and computing in the same activity.
 
These lessons guide the student in hands-on, practical measurement activities along with using the micro:bit to control and record data for the experiments. Each lesson provides an overview of the activity, outlines expected results, explains the setup of the experiment, and the gives a coding activity to measure and collect the data.

### ~hint

**MakeCode app**

To enable data collection in the experiments, the lessons require use of the **[Windows 10 MakeCode for micro:bit](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PJC7SV48LCX)** app instead of **[MakeCode](@homeurl@)** in the browser.

### @description code to detect States of Matter 

## Step 1: Make temperature simulation

Have you ever tried to represent the states of matter? Let's try to visually represent various states of matter based on atmospheric temperatures!

## Step 2: Variables.


In order for States of Matter to follow the rules for determining the  atmospheric temperature, we need to add variables that will store data. Then we will assign (set) the value of the variables. We want to name the two (2) variables as follows: “atmos_temperature” and “temperature”. Set the value of the variables to 100.  Modify your code so that your code looks like this.

```blocks
let temperature = 100
let atmos_temperature = 100

```


## Step 3: Detect a solid.

We want to detect a solid for the atmospheric temperature. On Pin 2 Pressed, you want to represent an atmospheric temperature of 0 and scroll the message SOLID. We want to set atmos_temperature to 0 and show string as a Solid. Modify your code so that your code looks like this:

```blocks
let temperature = 0
let atmos_temperature = 0
input.onPinPressed(TouchPin.P2, () => {
    atmos_temperature = 0
    basic.showString("SOLID")
})
atmos_temperature = 100
temperature = 100


```

## Step 4: Detect a liquid.

We want to detect a liquid for the atmospheric temperature. On Pin 1 Pressed, you want to represent an atmospheric temperature of 80 and scroll the message LIQUID. We want to set atmos_temperature to 80 and show string as a liquid. Modify your code so that your code looks like this:

```blocks
let temperature = 0
let atmos_temperature = 0
input.onPinPressed(TouchPin.P2, () => {
    atmos_temperature = 0
    basic.showString("SOLID")
})
input.onPinPressed(TouchPin.P1, () => {
    atmos_temperature = 80
    basic.showString("LIQUID")
})
atmos_temperature = 100
temperature = 100

```

## Step 5: Detect a gas.

We want to detect a liquid for the atmospheric temperature. On Pin 1 Pressed, you want to represent an atmospheric temperature of 80 and scroll the message LIQUID. We want to set atmos_temperature to 80 and show string as a liquid. Modify your code so that your code looks like this:

```blocks
let atmos_temperature = 0
let temperature = 0
input.onGesture(Gesture.Shake, () => {
    temperature += 50
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Triangle)
})
input.onPinPressed(TouchPin.P0, () => {
    atmos_temperature = 250
    basic.showString("GAS")
})
input.onPinPressed(TouchPin.P2, () => {
    atmos_temperature = 0
    basic.showString("SOLID")
})
input.onPinPressed(TouchPin.P1, () => {
    atmos_temperature = 80
    basic.showString("LIQUID")
})
atmos_temperature = 100
temperature = 100

```

## Step 6: Increase temperature.

We want to display a change of temperature on shake. When you shake the states of matter experiment, there will be a show icon to represent an increase in temperature. Modify your code so that your code looks like this:

```blocks
let atmos_temperature = 0
let temperature = 0
input.onGesture(Gesture.Shake, () => {
    temperature += 50
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Triangle)
})
input.onPinPressed(TouchPin.P0, () => {
    atmos_temperature = 250
    basic.showString("GAS")
})
input.onPinPressed(TouchPin.P2, () => {
    atmos_temperature = 0
    basic.showString("SOLID")
})
input.onPinPressed(TouchPin.P1, () => {
    atmos_temperature = 80
    basic.showString("LIQUID")
})
atmos_temperature = 100
temperature = 100


```

## Step 6: Display temperature change.

We want to conditionally run code depending on whether a Boolean condition is true or false. We want to display certain icons to reflect the temperature being changed on shake. We will create two condition statements. After displaying an icon, the icon will be cleared from the screen with clear screen. Then we will pause program execution for 100 milliseconds. This function is helpful to slow down the program's execution.

The first condition statement follows this logic: 
- change the temperature by 20 if the temperature is less than the atmospheric temperature.
- change the temperature by -20 if the temperature is not less than the atmos_temperature. 

The second condition follows this logic: 
- show icon with a symbol of a solid if the temperature is less than 32 degrees.
- show icon with a sybmol of a liquid (umbrella) if the temperature is less than 212 degrees.
- show icon with a symbol of a gas if the temperature is greater than or equal to 212 degrees.  

```blocks
let atmos_temperature = 0
let temperature = 0
input.onGesture(Gesture.Shake, () => {
    temperature += 50
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Triangle)
})
basic.forever(() => {
    if (temperature < atmos_temperature) {
        temperature += 20
    } else {
        temperature += -20
    }
    if (temperature < 32) {
        basic.showIcon(IconNames.Square)
    } else if (temperature < 212) {
        basic.showIcon(IconNames.Umbrella)
    } else {
        basic.showIcon(IconNames.Chessboard)
    }
    basic.clearScreen()
    basic.pause(100)
})
input.onPinPressed(TouchPin.P0, () => {
    atmos_temperature = 250
    basic.showString("GAS")
})
input.onPinPressed(TouchPin.P2, () => {
    atmos_temperature = 0
    basic.showString("SOLID")
})
input.onPinPressed(TouchPin.P1, () => {
    atmos_temperature = 80
    basic.showString("LIQUID")
})
atmos_temperature = 100
temperature = 100

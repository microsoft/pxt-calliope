# Declaring variables

How to declare and use variables.

## @parent language

A variable is a place where you can store and retrieve data. Variables have a name, a [type](/types), and a value:

* *name* is how you'll refer to the variable
* *type* is the kind of data a variable can store
* *value* is what's stored in the variable

## The variable (var) statement

A variable is created using a `variable` statement. The variable will "declare" itself in this statement. In MakeCode JavaScript a variable is declared along with its first [assignment](/blocks/variables/assign):

```typescript
let x = 2
```

With Python a variable is declared when it's first used. In this case the variable statement is just the assignment of the variable:

```python
x = 2
```

If a variable is declared in blocks you will see the ``||variables:set||`` block with the first use of the variable. This code stores the number `2` in the `x` variable:

```blocks
let x = 2
```

The new variable is created inside the ``||variables:Variables||`` category of the **Toolbox**.

#### Creating a variable from the Toolbox

In the ``||variables:Variables||`` category of the **Toolbox** you can create new variable:

Here's how to create a variable using the Toolbox:

1. Click ``||variables:Variables||`` in the Toolbox.
2. Click on **Make a Variable...**.
3. Choose a name for your variable, type it in, and click **Ok**.
4. Drag the new variable, ``||variables:set||`` or ``||variables:change||`` block into your code.

### Quick example

A variable is created for the number returned by the [brightness](/reference/led/brightness) function.

```blocks
let b = led.brightness()
```

## Using variables

Once you've defined a variable, just use the variable's name whenever you need what's stored in the variable. For example, the following code shows the value stored in `counter` on the LED screen:

```blocks
let counter = 1
basic.showNumber(counter)
```

To change the contents of a variable use the assignment operator. The following code sets `counter` to 1 and then increments `counter` by 10:

```blocks
let counter = 1
counter = counter + 10
basic.showNumber(counter)
```

## Why use variables?

If you want to remember and modify data, you'll need a variable. 
A counter is a great example:

```blocks
let counter = 0;
input.onButtonEvent(Button.A, input.buttonEventValue(ButtonEvent.Down), () => { 
  counter = counter + 1;
  basic.showNumber(counter);
});
```

## Local variables

Local variables exist only within the function or block of code where they're defined. For example:

```blocks
// x does NOT exist here.
if (led.brightness() > 128) {
    // x exists here
    let x = 0
}
```

## Notes about variables

### Variable names

Some blocks come from the Toolbox with default variable names, such as `list` from ``||arrays:Arrays||``.
You can use the default variable names if you like, however, it's best to use descriptive variable names. To change a variable name in the editor, select the down arrow next to the variable and then click **"Rename variable..."** to change it.

### Hidden declaration block

If a variable is used more than once, and its declaration block sets the variable to `0`, that first declaration block is hidden. For example:

```blocks
let x = 0
if (x == 0) {
    x = 9
}
```

You don't see any first block setting the variable `x` to `0` but that happens in its hidden declaration statement. You'll see the declaration statement, `let x = 0`, if you switch from Blocks to JavaScript in the Editor:

```typescript-ignore
let x = 0
if (x == 0) {
    x = 9
}
```

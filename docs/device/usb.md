# Uploading programs to your @boardname@

Most of the time you'll be writing and testing your programs in the [simulator](/device/simulator). Once you've finished your program though, you can **compile** it and run it on your @boardname@. Transferring your program to the @boardname@ is as simple as saving a file to a drive on your computer.

When you plug your @boardname@ into USB, a new drive is created with the **@drivename@** label. This is where you'll save your program.

The basic steps are:

1. Connect your @boardname@ to your computer with a USB cable.
2. Click **Download** to download the `.hex` file.
3. Move the `.hex` file from your computer onto the **@drivename@** drive. The next section has instructions for the browser that you're using.
